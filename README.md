# zag

A fast http web framework written in Zig ‚ö°Ô∏èü¶ñ

This is just a fun project and not meant to be taken seriously or used for production purposes. Lots of cool ideas for this one.

In the future, I might spend more time making it an actual framework. Once async sticks around zig's stdlib for a bit, zig gets closer to a 1.0 release, and I have more time to spend on it.
